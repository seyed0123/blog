When you are working on a project you need to use .env to store information like database username and password.
This is better to distinct the user and other models except in situations that they are so relative.
To get requirement.txt you can use pip freeze that give you the versions that are using in the project too.
To have a better structure for responses usually use functions like success_response and error_responses that handle pagination too.
You need another end point like get-me that returns the details of a user.(This is used for a profile page in frontend)
